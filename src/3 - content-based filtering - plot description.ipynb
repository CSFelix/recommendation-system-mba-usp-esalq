    "`Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)` applies ZIPF's Law on texts affirming that the word importance for a text is influenced by two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The Word Frequency in the Text** - `the more frequent the word is, the higher is its importance for the text`;\n",

    "Let's dive into a simple example about the usage of TF-IDF where we want to measure the 'fox' word importance in the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. What a fox!\n",
    "\n",
    "- A quick brown fox jumps over a lazy fox. What a fox!\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the Term Frequency (TF) of 'fox' for each document. The idea is to divide the word frequency by the total number of words in the document:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF('fox', first_sentence)} = \\frac{2}{12} = 0.17\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF('fox', second_sentence)} = \\frac{3}{12} = 0.25\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) of 'fox' in the whole set of documents. The IDF is a constant for each word in the whole document and it is given by calculating the log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the word. The log base can be any value, being 2, 10 and e the most common ones. For this example, let's consider 10 as the log base:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{IDF('fox', all_documents)} = \\log_{10} \\frac{2}{2} = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of 'fox' for each sentence. The TF-IDF is calculated by multiplying the TF by the IDF value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF('fox', first_sentence)} = TF \\cdot IDF = 0.17 \\cdot 0 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{TF-IDF('fox', second_sentence)} = TF \\cdot IDF = 0.25 \\cdot 0 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Get the 'fox' importance for the sentences. Since the TF-IDF for the word in both sentences is zero, 'fox' is not so much important to differentiate both sentences!! Besides, considering that the TF-IDF value is the same for both sentences, 'fox' is equally relevant for both documents.\n",
