    "Collaborative Filtering has some issues that we have to pay attention, being the `computational cost and time` the first one. As seen on Collaborative Filtering Item-Based Algorithm, a laptop with 12GB of RAM memory got 100% usage of this hardware, even though the dataset's sample being small compared to the total amount of data: only a few more datas than a million observations out of up to twenty-three million.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is the `available data`. Since our dataset is large and contains observations from a bunch of users and animes, we did not face it off, but it is important to have this issue in mind. Collaborative Filtering requires a good number of users ratings of each anime in order to better recognizing the users tastes and retrieving more suitable recommendations. Due to this, when the platform has new users or new released animes, the Collaborative Filtering may not work very well with them, since the available data about them is scarce.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for the first problem is literally using a more powerful machine too do the tasks, changing the algorithm for more performatic ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "About the second problem, we can go into `Hybrid Filtering`, the best and last Recommendation System Technique we are going to see in this project."

    "`Hybrid Filtering` combines the Content-Based Filtering and the Collaborative Filtering altogether. It normally applies the first technique when there are few users ratings available for a given anime and smoothly replaces it to the second technique as more users ratings become avaible for the given anime.\n",
