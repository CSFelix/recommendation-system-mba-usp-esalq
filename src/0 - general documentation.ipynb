    "Recommendation Systems are present everyday in our lives helping us to find the perfect anime to watch on Crunchyroll, to keep us binge watching related YouTube videos or even to buy new products on Amazon. I can spend the whole day listing examples about these systems, but I think that you got the glimpse where Recommendation Systems are used, don't you?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, have you ever get bored on Netflix and Instagram because they only recommend items related to the same topic? It is not because I liked two videos about cars on Instagram that I am a huge fan of cars and want to see only reels and posts about it. Or it is not because I saw a gamer chair price on Amazon that I want to buy only gamer chairs. When you keep receiving recommendations only related to a especific topic or product, we say that you are into a Limited Bubble of Recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Bubble of Recomendations tends to make companies lose customers, so, in order to minimize these bubbles and to expand the recommendations' diversity, algorithms have been tuned and new variables have been considered to the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "When working with mean scores of products, we have a tendency to use the `Arithmetic Mean` rather than other metrics, however, it can be a problem for Recommendation System Models due to the difference between the score value and the amount of scores. For instance, picture an anime that has a Mean Score of 9.8 and only 100 votes, and another anime with a Mean Score of 8.5 and 100,000 votes. Which one is better? The one with the higher score and less votes or the one with the smaller score and more votes? In this case and statistically speaking, it is correct to assume that the one with the smaller score and more votes is the better because the difference of the amount of votes between the two animes is huge. So, we have just stumbled upon a problem: there are situations that the Arithmetic Mean is not suitable and can compromisse Recommendation Systems Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this in mind, we can use the `Cumulative Mean`. Its idea is similar to the Arithmetic one, but the difference is that the value is not divided by the number of votes. So, if an anime got two ratings of 10, we say that its Cumulative Mean is 20, while its Arithmetic Mean is 10. But, this method has a problem too: consider an anime with 1,000,000 ratings of 1 score and another anime with 10,000 ratings of 10 score, if we calculate their Cumulative Mean, the first anime will have a score of 1,000,000 whereas the second one will have a score of 100,000. So, even though having the better ratings, the anime can be in a bad rank position if the number of votes is substancial lower than an anime with worse ratings and a huge number of votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, up to now, we have this two metrics problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Arithmetic Mean** - `does not assume that an anime with lower score and huge number of ratings is better than an anime with higher score and only a few number of ratings`;\n",

    "\n",
    "<br /><br />\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve these two problems and to giver better, realistic mean scores, the `Bayesian Mean` has been created!! Its idea is simple, first we have to find the number of ratings of the item, the Arithmetic Mean of the item, the minimum number of ratings that an item must have to be considered in the system and the Arithmetic Mean across all items. After that, we apply them in the following equation:\n",

    "- C: Arithmetic Mean across all items.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation can also be used in its alternative form, resulting in the same result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bayesian_mean = ((c * m) + (n * r)) / (c + n)\n",

    "\n",

    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its good results, Bayesian Mean is used by IMDB to calculate the mean score of movies listed on the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it is highly recommended to start using Arithmetic Mean when there are a few ratings to an item and smoothly migrate to Bayesian Mean accordingly the number of ratings increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some observations about this metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "- for an item with a fewer than average number of ratings - the score should be around the system’s Arithmetic Mean;\n",
